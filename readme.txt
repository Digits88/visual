Visual is a dark minimalist WordPress theme for displaying photos and images.

This theme makes use of several libraries and scripts built by others.  A big thanks to everyone who has worked on these projects:

* Visual was built off the foundation of Underscores (_s):

* Font:

- Raleway (http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Raleway)

* Selected glyphs in the icon font from:

- Entypo by Daniel Bruce (http://www.entypo.com/)
